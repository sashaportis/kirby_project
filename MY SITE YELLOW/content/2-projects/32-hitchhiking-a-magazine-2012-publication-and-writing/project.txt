Text: The contents of this magazine were generated through hitchhiking. Every ride is an article and every episode of rides is an issue. For this series we hitchhiked in the San Juan Islands of Puget Sound. The magazine was distributed physically in increments through the Torrance Art Museum in association with Bakers Dozen 4 and digitally via email as PDFs. (In collaboration with Fiona Connor.)
